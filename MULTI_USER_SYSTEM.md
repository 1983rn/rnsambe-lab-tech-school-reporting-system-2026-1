# Multi-User Concurrent Access System

## Overview

The School Reporting System now supports **multi-user concurrent access**, allowing up to 4 users from the same school to work simultaneously on different forms (1, 2, 3, and 4) without data interference or system compromise.

## Key Features

### 1. User Management
- **4 Default Users per School**: Each school gets 4 pre-configured users
- **Form-Specific Access**: Each user is assigned to a specific form
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Users can only access their assigned forms
- **Secure Authentication**: Password-protected user accounts

### 2. Conflict Prevention
- **Real-time Conflict Detection**: Prevents simultaneous editing of the same form
- **Access Locking**: When a user is working on a form, others are blocked
- **Activity Monitoring**: Tracks active users and their current work
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: First user gets priority, others get notified

### 3. Shared School Settings
- **Centralized Configuration**: All users share the same school settings
- **Consistent Academic Periods**: Same terms and academic years for all users
- **Unified Subject Management**: Subjects are shared across all forms
- **Common School Information**: School name, address, contact details shared

### 4. Data Integrity
- **Persistent Storage**: Data remains intact after logout or inactivity
- **Automatic Backups**: Regular backups prevent data loss
- **Concurrent Safe**: Database operations handle multiple users safely
- **Activity Logging**: All user actions are tracked and logged

## User Accounts

### Default User Creation
For each school, 4 users are automatically created:

| Form | Username | Password | Full Name |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Form 1 | `[SCHOOL_NAME]_form1` | `Form1Teacher2024` | `[SCHOOL_NAME] - Form 1 Teacher` |
| Form 2 | `[SCHOOL_NAME]_form2` | `Form2Teacher2024` | `[SCHOOL_NAME] - Form 2 Teacher` |
| Form 3 | `[SCHOOL_NAME]_form3` | `Form3Teacher2024` | `[SCHOOL_NAME] - Form 3 Teacher` |
| Form 4 | `[SCHOOL_NAME]_form4` | `Form4Teacher2024` | `[SCHOOL_NAME] - Form 4 Teacher` |

**Note**: Replace `[SCHOOL_NAME]` with the actual school name (lowercase, underscores for spaces).

### Example
For "DEMO SECONDARY SCHOOL":
- Form 1: `demo_secondary_school_form1` / `Form1Teacher2024`
- Form 2: `demo_secondary_school_form2` / `Form2Teacher2024`
- Form 3: `demo_secondary_school_form3` / `Form3Teacher2024`
- Form 4: `demo_secondary_school_form4` / `Form4Teacher2024`

## How It Works

### 1. Login Process
1. User selects "School" user type
2. Enters their username and password
3. System authenticates and redirects to multi-user dashboard
4. User sees only their assigned forms

### 2. Form Access Control
1. User clicks on their assigned form
2. System checks for conflicts (other users on same form)
3. If clear, user gets exclusive access
4. If conflict, user sees error message with details

### 3. Concurrent Work
1. Multiple users can work on different forms simultaneously
2. Each user has their own session and activity tracking
3. Real-time monitoring prevents data conflicts
4. Automatic saving prevents data loss

### 4. Activity Monitoring
- **Heartbeat System**: Users send regular activity updates
- **Session Tracking**: Monitors active users per form
- **Conflict Alerts**: Notifies users of access attempts
- **Activity Logs**: Records all user actions

## Technical Implementation

### Database Tables

#### `school_users`
- Stores individual user accounts
- Links users to schools
- Manages form assignments
- Tracks user status and activity

#### `user_activity_log`
- Records all user actions
- Tracks form access and modifications
- Provides conflict detection data
- Enables audit trails

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - Multi-user login support
- Automatic user type detection
- Session management

#### Multi-User Features
- `POST /api/user-heartbeat` - Activity monitoring
- `POST /api/check-form-conflicts` - Conflict detection
- `GET /api/user-activity/<id>` - Activity log retrieval
- `GET /api/check-form-status` - Global form status

#### User Interface
- `/multi-user-dashboard` - User-specific dashboard
- `/form/<level>/multi-user` - Protected form entry
- Real-time conflict indicators
- Activity status displays

### Security Features

#### Access Control
- Form-specific permissions
- Session-based authentication
- Automatic timeout protection
- Secure password hashing

#### Data Protection
- Concurrent-safe database operations
- Automatic conflict resolution

- Regular backup systems

## Setup Instructions

### For New Schools
1. School admin creates school account
2. System automatically creates 4 user accounts
3. Admin distributes credentials to teachers
4. Teachers login with their assigned credentials

### For Existing Schools
Run the setup script:
```bash
python setup_multi_user.py
```

This will:
- Create user tables if they don't exist
- Generate default users for all existing schools
- Display user credentials for distribution

### Testing the System
Run the test script:
```bash
python test_multi_user.py
```

This verifies:
- User table creation
- Default user generation
- Authentication system
- Form access control
- Conflict detection
- Activity logging
